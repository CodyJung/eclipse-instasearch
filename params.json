{"name":"InstaSearch Eclipse plug-in","body":"InstaSearch - Eclipse plug-in for quick code search\r\n==\r\n\r\nInstaSearch is an  Eclipse plug-in for performing quick and advanced search of workspace files. It indexes files using [Lucene](http://lucene.apache.org/core/) and keeps the index up to date automatically. The search is performed instantly as-you-type and resulting files are displayed in an Eclipse view.\r\n\r\nEach file then can be previewed using few most matching and relevant lines. A double-click on the match leads to the matching line in the file.\r\n\r\nDownload / Installation\r\n--\r\nIn Eclipse Helios (3.6) or Indigo (3.7) please install using the **Eclipse Marketplace** from the *Help* menu ([how-to](http://marketplace.eclipse.org/updatesite/help?url=http://code.inf.unibz.it/instasearch/downloads/))\r\n\r\nAlternatively you can install using the update site `http://code.inf.unibz.it/instasearch/downloads/`\r\n\r\nJava 1.5 or newer is required\r\n\r\n( [Add to favorites](http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/instasearch) on Eclipse Marketplace.)\r\n\r\nMain Features\r\n--\r\n* Instantly shows search results\r\n* Shows a preview using relevant lines\r\n* Periodically updates the index\r\n* Matches partial words (e.g. case in CamelCase)\r\n* Opens and highlights matches in files\r\n* Searches JAR source attachments\r\n* Supports filtering by extension/project/working set\r\n\r\nScreenshot:\r\n![Screenshot](http://code.inf.unibz.it/instasearch/downloads/images/instasearch_new.jpg)\r\n\r\nSearch Tips\r\n---\r\nLucene [query syntax](http://lucene.apache.org/core/old_versioned_docs/versions/3_0_0/queryparsersyntax.html) can be used for searching. This includes:\r\n\r\n* Wildcard searches\r\n  * `app* initialize`\r\n* Excluding words\r\n  * `application -initialize`\r\n* Fuzzy searches to find similar matches\r\n   * `application init~`\r\n* Limit by location - directory, projects or working set\r\n   * `proj:MyProject,OtherProject  application  init `\r\n   * `ws:MyWorkingSet  dir:src  init `\r\n* Limit by filename, extension or modification time\r\n   * `name:app*  ext:java,xml,txt  modified:yesterday  `\r\n* Search by file name initials (e.g. FOS to find FileOutputStream.java)\r\n   * `name:FOS`\r\n\r\nTo exclude some folders from search indexing, mark them as *Derived* in the folder's properties.\r\nThere are also useful Eclipse Search Tips.\r\n\r\n**Note**: Fuzzy search is started automatically if no exact matches are found\r\n\r\nBugs/Enhancement Requests\r\n---\r\nIf you notice any issues with the plugin or have an idea for an enhancement, please open a new ticket\r\n\r\nAuthors/Contributors\r\n---\r\nAuthor:  [Andrejs Jermakovics](http://github.com/ajermakovics)\r\n\r\nContributors:  [Holger Voormann](http://eclipsehowl.wordpress.com/)\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to contribute feel free to get in touch or create a  pull request. \r\n","tagline":"Eclipse plug-in for fast code search","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
